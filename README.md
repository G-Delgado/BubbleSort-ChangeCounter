# bubble-sort-change-counter
## S4_Delgado_Gabriel
This program, part of the 'capstone homework' of the 4th week receives a first line **n** that describes the amount of cases.
Each case has **i** numbers (of type *double*).
The program sorts each case (*array*) with bubble sort and returns the average of the changes per iteration in the algorithm followed by a separator **"-"** and the sorted array of numbers
